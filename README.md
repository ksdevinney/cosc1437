# Programming Fundamentals II- COSC 1437

This repo contains my notes from Programming Fundamentals II, taken at Dallas College during summer 2022. This class used Java as its language. My notes cover the main points from each chapter. Topics covered include data types, arrays, decision structures, loops, and classes. 

Also included in this repo are the assignments I turned in for this class. Each assignment had strict rules about the naming conventions for the methods and classes in the program, as well as what each program should be expected to do.
