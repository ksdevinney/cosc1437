# Chapter 4: Decision Structures

## if Statements

Allows program to execute some statements only under certain circumstances

In Java:
if (boolean expression)
    statement;

Relational operators:
< > >= <= != ==

if can also be used to execute a group of statements; if there is more than one statement, they must be enclosed in braces

flag: boolean that signals some condition exists in the program

Can use relational operators to compare characters; characters are compared by unicode values

## if-else

will execute one group of statements if the boolean expression evaluates to true, and a different set of statements if the boolean evaluates to false

(actually shown as two separate statements: if/else and additional if)

## nested if

If statements can be nested inside another if statement to test more than one condition

## if-else-if

tests a series of conditions, probably simpler than if else

trailing else: at the end of if-else series, for when none of the conditions pass

## Logical Operators

connect two or more relational expressions

&& and
|| or
! not
